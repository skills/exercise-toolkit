# This workflow uses a Personal Access Token instead of built-in GITHUB_TOKEN to create the pull request
# This is necessary because it commits changes to workflow files, which is not allowed with the default GITHUB_TOKEN.
# See example https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/issues/3558
# The PAT needs to have `contents: write` `pull-requests: write` and `workflows: write` permissions.
